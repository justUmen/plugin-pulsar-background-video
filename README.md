### Play videos/images in background

Also system-wide, I personally use 4 different electron apps that will use the same images/videos.

⚠️ WARNING: I've just started porting this to Pulsar (from Atom), not everything is working yet. :p

## Installation

Move to your pulsar packages folder, clone this repo with the name "background-video-player" and install npm dependencies :

    cd ~/.pulsar/packages/
    git clone https://github.com/justUmen/plugin-pulsar-background-video background-video-player

Launch Pulsar.  
Change for custom variables in Settings and restart Pulsar.
